Hey,

I'm Ernest, a software engineer interested in a range of topics not limited to CLIs,
developer tools and backend.
I enjoy tinkering around, seeing how things work underneath
(~*this is a recurring theme*) and then try to re-implemenet them


I truly beleive that software enginnering is an *art*, and people should enjoy it.
