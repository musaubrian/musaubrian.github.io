I've never been that big of a reflections type of person, but people keep
saying that its good for you, so let's give it a try.

Looking back, I've managed to acomplish quite a bit, both in my professional
and personal life, and challenges as well,
but those I believe are _personal_ at least for me and won't go into those
right now.

On the achievements,
- Graduated uni with a second class upper honors
- Got a few internships, and a job
- A lot of personal stuff

But one of the best things I've acquired this is year is that __You can just do
stuff__.
This mentality helped me move so much further, I'd say, than how I did last
year.

I managed to tackle tasks much much outside my comfort zone

As for this year, I wish to:
- keep pushing outside my comfort zone
- be a better person
- live more in the moment
- be more intentional

It may not sound like much, but almost everything I wish to achieve this year
is covered by these four.


Let's see what the year has in store for us, godspeed
