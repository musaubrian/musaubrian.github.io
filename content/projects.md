Some of the things I've built:

### **[Netmon](https://github.com/musaubrian/netmon)**
Network monitoring tool built using Go.
Built it to answer the question, what if you could view the results of ping on a graph from anywhere
Also kind of my first *serious -if you could call it that- in Go

### **[Tg](https://github.com/musaubrian/tg)**
A tiny cli based password manager.
I was just tired of trying to remember password so I built this

### **[Rgn](https://github.com/musaubrian/rgn)**
This is also a CLI tool I built to allow me do most of my common actions on github directly from a terminal.
Its basically a shittier stripped down version of github's cli.

### **[Sik](https://github.com/musaubrian)**
Cheap knockoff of [seroost](https://github.com/tsoding/seroost) which is a local search engine.
But I built it to allow me search through my notes
