| ---                                                | ---                                                                                                                       |
| **[Netmon](https://github.com/musaubrian/netmon)** | network monitoring tool built using Go                                                                                    |
| **[Tg](https://github.com/musaubrian/tg)**         | simple CLI password manager built in Go                                                                                   |
| **[RepoGen](https://github.com/musaubrian/rgn)**   | Let's you create repos on github from the terminal                                                                        |
| **[PyNet](https://github.com/musaubrian/pynet)**   | Send files over the networj using python. (this was more of a proof of concept)                                           |
| **[Gno](https://github.com/musaubrian/gno)**       | A custom build system built in go. Heavily inspired by **[nobuild](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild)** just not as good |
