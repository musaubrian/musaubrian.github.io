Some of the things I've built:

### **[pye.nvim](https://github.com/musaubrian/pye.nvim)**
A neovim plugin that auto activates a virtual environment if present in your project.


### **[Sik](https://github.com/musaubrian)**
A local search engine fro your notes.

Indexes and allows you to search through your notes.
This was inspired by [seroost](https://github.com/tsoding/seroost) which is a local search engine for documentation.
But I built it to allow me search through my markdown notes


### **[Tg](https://github.com/musaubrian/tg)**
A tiny cli based password manager.
I was just tired of trying to remember password so I built this

### **[Rgn](https://github.com/musaubrian/rgn)**
This is also a CLI tool I built to allow me do most of my common actions on github directly from a terminal.
Its basically a shittier stripped down version of github's cli.
