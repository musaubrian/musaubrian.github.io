      <description>OS I have been dailying Pop!_os for over a year now and its honestly been a great time. It only broke twice and both times were my fault -can&amp;rsquo;t really blame me :). Nothing bad to say about except that the pop store lags really really badly, but I rarely use it anywway.&#xA;Tmux This is a must have for me, I never thought I could like a piece of software as much as a I like tmux Not I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that I&amp;rsquo;m a guru at using tmux, but the ability to create sessions and detach from sessions was a game changer for me.</description>
