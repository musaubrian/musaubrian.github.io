      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been dailying neovim for a while now and I decided to use the nightly build because why not, and it was okay for most things, I mean it is neovim after all.&#xA;But it kept crashing for reasons I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really ready to figure out, so I did the sane thing - moved back to the stable version. It was great and all but I missed the default theme that came with the nightly builds, it was really clean, and also I liked TJ&amp;rsquo;s theme(gruvbuddy) -very few colors on the screen.</description>
