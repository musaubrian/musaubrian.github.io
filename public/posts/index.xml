      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been dailying neovim for a while now and I decided to use the nightly build because why not, and it was okay for most things, I mean it is neovim after all.&#xA;But it kept crashing for reasons I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really ready to figure out, so I did the sane thing - moved back to the stable version. It was great and all but I missed the default theme that came with the nightly builds, it was really clean, and also I liked TJ&amp;rsquo;s theme(gruvbuddy) -very few colors on the screen.</description>

      <description>I recently was working with django and I kinda wanted to still use tailwind in the world of python.&#xA;Now I&amp;rsquo;d never setup a django project from scratch before, I usually picked up from someone else. But this time I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so lucky.&#xA;1. Install tailwindcss, # at the root of your project npm install -D tailwindcss npx tailwindcss init 2. Configuring TaiwindCSS Configure the tailwind.config.js to capture all your files with tailwind classes.</description>

      <description>OS I have been dailying Pop!_os for over a year now and its honestly been a great time. It only broke twice and both times were my fault -can&amp;rsquo;t really blame me :). Nothing bad to say about except that the pop store lags really really badly, but I rarely use it anywway.&#xA;Tmux This is a must have for me, I never thought I could like a piece of software as much as a I like tmux Not I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that I&amp;rsquo;m a guru at using tmux, but the ability to create sessions and detach from sessions was a game changer for me.</description>
