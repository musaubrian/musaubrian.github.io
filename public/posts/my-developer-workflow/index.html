  <div class="single-content">
    <h2 id="os">OS</h2>
<p>I have been dailying Pop!_os for over a year now and its honestly been a great time.
It only broke twice and both times were my fault -can&rsquo;t really blame me :).
Nothing bad to say about except that the pop store lags really really badly, but I rarely use it anywway.</p>
<h2 id="tmux">Tmux</h2>
<p>This is a must have for me, I never thought I could like a piece of software as much as a I like tmux
Not I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m a guru at using tmux, but the ability to create sessions and detach from sessions
was a game changer for me.</p>
<p>I took this to the next level when I <em>&lsquo;reverse engineered&rsquo;</em>  thePrimeagen&rsquo;s tmux sessionizer and I started flying in my projects.</p>
<h2 id="neovim">Neovim</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using neovim for more than a year and I don&rsquo;t have that many a complaints,
it kind of forced me to learn how neovim works to debug some of the errors I found and its been great so far.</p>
<p>The main selling point for me was the personalised development experience(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg&amp;pp=ygULdGVlal9kdiBwZGU%3D">PDE</a>)
where you customize it to your liking, which I absolutely <del>abused</del> utilized.</p>
<h2 id="alacritty">Alacritty</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using alacritty for a while now and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be changing anytime soon.
I&rsquo;ll rethink my stance after the <a href="https://blog.pop!_os.com">Cosmic DE</a> gets released
and I get to try out their new cosmic terminal that is based on alacritty -I think.</p>
<p>The main reason I chose alacritty was -spoiler! its pretty dumb reason- that the content I could fit on my laptop screen was not that much
considering the gtk title bar thingy.</p>
<p>I know I know, just use the default terminal in fullscreen -tried it didn&rsquo;t really like it in fullscreen.
Hide the top bar -no, I kinda like it, so it stays.
Use a tiling window manager -tried it wasn&rsquo;t really convinced, plus I like how pop os does the auto tiling.</p>
<p>Also I liked the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/alacritty">dracula theme</a></p>
<hr>
<p>For the shell I use ZSH with the a configured starship prompt and oh-my-zsh for the zsh-autosuggestions plugin</p>
<p>For the rest of the things I use, they are mostly tools/scripts I built for me, but I feel that they deserve a mention.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/musaubrian/rgn">Rgn</a> -&gt; a very lightweight ripoff of the github cli because I didn&rsquo;t need that many features</li>
<li>notes -&gt; tmux sessionizer but for my notes, I just wanted to open them up and start
typing or be in the right place</li>
<li>We can&rsquo;t forget the amazing <a href=""><strong>fzf</strong></a>, its what allowed me to create my sessionizer</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d just be mean to not mention ripgrep as its used by one of my favourite neovim plugins, telescope.</li>
<li>Iosevka font - I found it to be a bit pleasing to the eye. I don&rsquo;t really think it matters that much, but some people do</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I also sneak in a little bit of vscode and jetbrains IDEs from time to time, its no biggie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there we have it, the tools I use on a daily basis.</p>
